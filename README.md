MELC is a cutting-edge approach to query processing that leverages multi-agent LLM interactions through an integrated system of critical analysis and consensus validation. The method implements distributed expert evaluation with confidence-weighted responses to achieve high-reliability outputs in complex decision-making scenarios.

## 🏗️ Core Architecture

The method employs a three-phase processing pipeline:
```
User Query → [Parallel Expert Evaluation] → [Cross-Validation] → [Consensus Synthesis] → Final Response
```
